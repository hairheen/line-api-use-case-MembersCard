## Input test data to DynamoDB

  For this app to work, it's necessary to submit data to the DynamoDB table you have created.
  Put the sample data into the table with the table name set in ProductInfoDBName in template.yaml when deploying the membership card app.
  The test data is a json format string of dynamodb_data/product_master_id_1.json ~ product_master_id_2.json in the backend > APP folder.
  Paste and submit the file in the DynamoDB console of the AWS management console. (*See image below)
